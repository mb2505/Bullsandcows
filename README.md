# Bullsandcows
Bulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls or Pigs and Bulls) is an old code-breaking mind or paper and pencil game for two or more players, predating the commercially marketed board game Mastermind. It is a game that may date back a century or more which uses numbers or words.

Example:

Input the length of the secret code:
> 4
Input the number of possible symbols in the code:
> 12
The secret is prepared: **** (0-9, a-b).
Okay, let's start a game!

// Now you have to enter a 4 digit alphanumeric number and repeat this process until you get 4 bulls.

Turn 1:
> a234
Grade: 1 bull and 1 cow
Turn 2:
> 73b4
Grade: 2 bulls and 1 cow
Turn 3:
> 9374
Grade: 4 bulls
Congratulations! You guessed the secret code.
